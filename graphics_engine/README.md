# VulkanBaseEngine

Template Vulkan engine to branch off into various projects 
I am interested in. I decided to take a very Object-Oriented 
direction with this engine as I think Vulkan objects lend 
themselves nicely to wrapper classes. However, I am still 
learning the best practices for C++. I will continue to add 
features and make improvements to the Base Engine branch as
they are needed in side projects.
